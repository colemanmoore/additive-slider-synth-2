# additive-slider-synth
An ASDFGHJK-playable monosynth with custom additive sine synthesis.

## How it works
Choose any combnination of 13 available harmonically related sine waves to turn on, detune, and adjust volume.

## Synthesis
Double click a slider to turn on the corresponding harmonic or to turn it of. Drag vertically to adjust the amplitude. Drag horizontally to detune the harmonic.

## Playing
The ASDFGHJK keys are mapped to a pentatonic scale. Once some harmonics are turned on, noodle to your heart's desire.
